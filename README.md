**Sonar Data – Mines vs Rocks Prediction**
Machine Learning Classification Project | Python | Scikit-learn

This project aims to classify underwater sonar signals as either:

Mines (M) → dangerous metal objects like explosives

Rocks (R) → harmless natural formations

Using various machine learning algorithms, we build, compare, and evaluate predictive models based on the UCI Sonar Dataset.

**Project Overview**

The Sonar Dataset contains 208 samples with 60 sonar-frequency energy features.
Goal: Build a model that can accurately classify an object as Mine or Rock based on sonar returns.

This project includes:

Data loading & preprocessing

Feature scaling

Model training with multiple ML algorithms

Model comparison

Accuracy, confusion matrix & evaluation metrics

Final deployment-ready prediction script
